# YAIM0425 d00b Core

---

## 📌 Description

**YAIM0425 d00b Core** is a **required support MOD** for other YAIM0425 mods.

By itself, this MOD does **not add new items, machines, or gameplay mechanics**. Its purpose is to work silently in the background and make sure other YAIM0425 mods run correctly, smoothly, and with maximum compatibility.

If you are using any MOD from the **YAIM0425** series, this core MOD provides:

* Shared systems used by all YAIM0425 mods
* Better compatibility with large overhaul mods
* Safer loading and fewer conflicts between mods
* Consistent behavior across different saves and mod packs

You can think of this MOD as the **engine behind the scenes**: players normally don’t interact with it directly, but it is essential for other mods to function properly.
